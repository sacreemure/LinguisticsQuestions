# LinguisticsQuestions
App for getting questions randomly for exam preparation. 
Made it solely for myself.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can choose files with questions. Programm retrieves 1 question from each document. 
I have 14 documents so 14 questions per day was enough for me.
All the questions are numerated.
There is a button below to generate a new list.

For the app I used Streamlit framework.
App is in Russian because questions I was retreaving are also in Russian.
